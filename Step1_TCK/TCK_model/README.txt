1) The files:
	* data_processor_balanceo
	* data_processor_no_balanceo

are files elaborated by me, which process the dataset, elaborating x_train, y_train, x_test and y_test.

2) The get_BloodData file is adequate to the needs to process the data obtained by the previous files.

3) The rest of the files are external files.

***** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DATASET USED *****
Granularity of the dataset -> numberOfTimeStep = 7, each hourPerTimeStep = 24 h
